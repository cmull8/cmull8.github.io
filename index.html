    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>  
    <p>
      This is a website that I want to make to put myself out there on the world wide web. A way to get my thoughts out there
      and share what I am doing and thinking. I obviously have a long way to go to make this corner of the internet worth your 
      time and attention, but I will slowly work on it as I go.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Cody Mull. I am a warrant officer in the  Illinois Army
      National Guard. I have served as a 25B (IT Specialist) for 7 years and deployed twice before I became a warrant officer. 
      I have worked in the past at Rivian as a MES Operations Analyst and at Connor Co. as a Systems Administrator. I went to school 
      at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois where I earned my BS in Information Systems Development and Analysis in 2022.
